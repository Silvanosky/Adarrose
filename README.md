# Adarrose

This project intend to make an automated sprinkler based on a STM32F429 board.

This project will use ADA langage and SPARK verification system.

## Description

We all know the trouble to keep a plant.
Specially in Paris where the light is low and where our lives goes to 100km/h.

We don't have time to water plant, if we have time we will most of the time give it to much water or to low and by the time we see it the plant will die.

Using very secure ADA langage and contract verification we will be able to keep our plant alive and have beautiful green environment without worrying about it.
